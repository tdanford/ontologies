1. fix the comment to has_protein_sequence
2. concrete sequence entity needs a definition
3. "canonical sequence" should be defined or removed? 
4. define 'global sequence alignment' -- every one of these is the specified output of one of those.
5. replace 'sequence' with 'ordered list' in the alignment def. 
"one" -> each -- each column carries a letter from *each* sequence, or a gap character.
- each column contributes a score to the alignment according to a matrix.
- the score is also an output of the global sequence alignment process
6. add domains and ranges to propertys
7. change "quality" to ... something descriptive.
8. specify inputs and outputs of the global sequence alignment.  
9. editor note to high-quality sequence: "placeholder, not good." 

10. show how to use it in tau?
