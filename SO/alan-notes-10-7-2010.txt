R : connects protein sequences to protein molecules that exist and bear them.

R is "has_sequence"^-1

C = a particular canonical sequences for Tau.

A = "class of protein alignments" 
inA = "relates protein sequences to alignments"
score = "relates alignments to scores" 

A_C = \exists inv(inA) . C 
An_C = A_C and \exists score . <n
S_C = \exists inA . Ak_C ( for some constant 'k' ) 
P_C = \exists has_sequence . S_C 

we assert that PRO:Tau \in P_C (upper bounding it!) 

Now work through with alignment parts.

Alan suggests: 

CPIE ("concrete protein information entity") 

has_sequence : CPIE -> protein

CPIE \in \exists denotes . ('biological sequence' and \exists (has_concretization o inheres_in) . protein)
