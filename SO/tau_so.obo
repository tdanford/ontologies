comment: "Could represent this relation as the chain of 'denotes', 'has_concretization', and 'inheres_in', for a subset of the SO sequence region terms."

comment: "A sequence alignment is itself a sequence of 'sequence alignment columns,' each of which carries either a single letter from one of the concrete sequences that participated in the alignment process, or a 'gap' character."

The following line should be added to the definition of 'microtubule-associated protein tau (human)'

# score = "relates alignments to scores"

# A_C = \exists inv(inA) . C 
# An_C = A_C and \exists score . <n
# S_C = \exists inA . Ak_C ( for some constant 'k' ) 
# P_C = \exists has_sequence . S_C 
# 
# we assert that PRO:Tau \in P_C (upper bounding it!)

# Now work through with alignment parts.

# Alan suggests: 
# 
# CPIE ("concrete protein information entity") 
# 
# has_sequence : CPIE -> protein
# 
# CPIE \in \exists denotes . ('biological sequence' and \exists (has_concretization o inheres_in) . protein)
