def: "A transcript which has undergone the necessary modifications, if any, for its function. In eukaryotes this includes, for example, processing of introns, cleavage, base modification, and modifications to the 5' and/or the 3' ends, other than addition of bases. In bacteria functional mRNAs are usually not modified." [SO:ke]

def: "Messenger RNA is the intermediate molecule between DNA and protein. It includes UTR and coding sequences. It does not contain introns." [SO:ma]
comment: An mRNA does not contain introns as it is a processed_transcript. The equivalent kind of primary_transcript is protein_coding_primary_transcript (SO:0000120) which may contain introns. This term is mapped to MGED. Do not obsolete without consulting MGED ontology.

def: "A sequence of amino acids linked by peptide bonds which may lack appreciable tertiary structure and may not be liable to irreversible denaturation." [SO:ma]
comment: This term is mapped to MGED. Do not obsolete without consulting MGED ontology. The term 'protein' was merged with 'polypeptide'. Although 'protein' was a sequence_attribute and therefore meant to describe the quality rather than an actual feature, it was being used erroneously. It is replaced by 'peptidyl' as the polymer attribute.
