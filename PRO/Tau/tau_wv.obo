## This first section defines some already existing terms, either
## from PRO or from other ontologies, which we'll use to build our 
## new terms from.

## Note, in the first definition, the existing Tau definition taken from PRO,
## both PHF tau and NFT tau are given as "exact" synonyms.  Is that really correct? 
## It seems as if these would be more correctly listed as "related", since not all forms
## of Tau are actually part of the PHFs or NFTs, no?
